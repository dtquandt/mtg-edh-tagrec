# mtg-edh-tagrec
Tag-based card recommendation system for MTG commander

Simple prototype webapp that allows attributing scores to different tags (based on Scryfall tagger) and then get card recommendations that maximize those scores.

TODO:
- Allow pulling from more sources than just Archidekt
- Allow setting color identity manually rather than importing a decklist
- Allow adding filters using scryfall search syntax (this may be too complex)
